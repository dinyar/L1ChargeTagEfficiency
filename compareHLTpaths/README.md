Scripts in this directory compare two HLT paths in a given dataset. 
The two HLT paths are both targetting J/Psi candidates, once using an opposite
sign (OS)reqirement and once not. The scripts select reconstructed J/Psis and
use those to determine the OS path efficiency.

The PAT tuples used for this were generated with CMSSW_7_4_6_patch6.
